# Specification: Update README.md

## 1. Overview
The current `README.md` is the default template generated by Vite. This track aims to replace it with a comprehensive, project-specific README that effectively onboards new developers and users to the Agent Skills Directory project.

## 2. Content Requirements

### 2.1 Project Header
- **Title:** Agent Skills Directory
- **Description:** A brief explanation of the project's purpose (searchable directory and machine-readable registry for LLM skills).
- **Deployment Link:** Clearly link to the live site at [skillindex.dev](https://skillindex.dev).

### 2.2 Sections
The `README.md` must include the following distinct sections:

1.  **Project Overview:** A more detailed explanation of the goals (Searchable Directory & Machine-Readable Registry) and target audience (Developers, Skill Creators, Tool Builders).
2.  **Tech Stack & Architecture:**
    -   Frontend: React (Vite), TypeScript
    -   Styling: Tailwind CSS, Lucide React
    -   Data: `skills.json` (Single Source of Truth), Zod (Validation)
    -   Deployment: Cloudflare Pages
3.  **Local Development Setup:**
    -   Prerequisites (Node.js version, etc.)
    -   Step-by-step instructions to clone, install dependencies (`npm install`), and start the dev server (`npm run dev`).
4.  **Contributing Guidelines:**
    -   A concise guide on how to add a new skill.
    -   Steps: Fork the repo -> Add skill to `skills.json` -> Create Pull Request.
    -   Mention automated schema validation.
5.  **License:**
    -   State that the project is licensed under the MIT License.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
-   **Format:** Markdown.
-   **Clarity:** Use clear, accessible language suitable for open-source contributors.
-   **Style:** Adhere to the project's "clean and minimal" aesthetic even in documentation.

## 4. Out of Scope
-   Creating a separate `CONTRIBUTING.md` file (content will be inline).
-   Changing actual project code or configuration (documentation update only).
